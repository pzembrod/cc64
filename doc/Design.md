# Design

These pages contain a slowly growing description of cc64's inner structure.

## Goals & Ideas

The [Goals & Ideas page](Goals-ideas.md) focuses on the design goals
and basic ideas of cc64.

## Sources Overview

The [Sources Overview page](Sources-overview.md) gives an overview of the
compiler's architecture through a short overview of its most important
source files.

## Transient Headers & Code

The [Transient Headers & Code page](Transient-headers.md) describes
the mechanism and use of transient word headers and transient code,
i.e. word headers and code that are present while cc64 itself is compiled
but aren't part of the final cc64 binary.
